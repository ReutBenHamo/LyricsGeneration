# Lyrics generation using RNNs
This repository houses a recurrent neural network implementation for generating lyrics from melodies as part of Ben-Gurion University's Deep Learning course assignment. 
The assignment tasks students with experimenting on real-world datasets and integrating diverse sources of information, like lyrics and melodies, into a cohesive framework using PyTorch.
